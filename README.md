# Week-by-week breakdown

## Week 1 - Programming challenges
Learning how to approach algorithmic problems. How to debug by generating tests against a naive algorithm.

## Week 2 - Algorithmic warm-up
Covering greatest common divisor and fibonacci numbers.

## Week 3 - Greedy algorithms
Make a greedy choice (e.g. max, min) to reduce the size of the problem then iterate. For a greedy choice to be safe the first choice must be optimal.
